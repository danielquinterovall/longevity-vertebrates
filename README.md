# Longest-Living Vertebrates Barplot (ggplot2)

This repository contains an R script that generates a bar chart of vertebrate species with the highest recorded maximum longevity. Bars are colored according to species origin (wild vs captivity), using data from AnAge: The animal ageing and longevity database (2024 release).

This project has two main goals:
1. To explore and visualize curious and striking longevity records across vertebrates (e.g., sharks that can live for several centuries).
2. To provide a simple and clean example of how to create aesthetic and readable bar charts using `ggplot2`.

## What this script does

- Uses curated longevity data from AnAge (2024)  
- Selects vertebrate species with the highest maximum longevity  
- Creates a bar chart with bars colored by species origin (wild vs captivity)  
- Applies basic visual customization to improve readability and aesthetics  
- Produces a publication- or presentation-ready figure
